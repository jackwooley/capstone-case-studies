13,This output can be evaled into the running shell and used by further runs of many tools.
15,aws cli should just properly implement that itself.

19,The API to do that is sadly not a standard AWS API.
20,The [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/example_sts_Scenario_ConstructFederatedUrl_section.html) just circulates a Python script to do that.
22,Going from access key to console log is supported_ but only using unrelated scripts.

28,The Tasks started by Code Pipeline also should be successfully placed.
30,"The closest matching container instance <my instance> is missing an attribute required by your task. I tried running
   but it returns ""None"" for missing attributes."
31,Since I am running Blue/Green deployment I decided to try to update the Tasks with Code Pipeline_ but after building the container the Deployment gets stuck   the newly created Task is in state PROVISIONING_ more EC2 instances get spawned by my  ASG but the Task never gets deployed.
32,"When I do
 I get 
 which make me think that there is a bug somewhere in  enable execute command for Blue/Green Deployments."
33,The moment I turn back enableExecuteCommand to false in my Service the Tasks (in both cases I describe) get immediately placed on the cluster.
34,"I also tried running this tool [amazon ecs exec checker](https://github.com/aws containers/amazon ecs exec checker) but everything else but ""Exec Enabled for Task"" is green."
35,I also tried manually to compare the attributes required by my Task Definition and the ones I have on my Container Instance and everything seems to be present.
